# Hyperparameter Optimization Workflow

Following scientific best practices for large-scale graph embedding optimization.

## Overview

We use a **representative 20% subgraph** for hyperparameter optimization, following the methodology from "Start Small, Think Big" (ECML-PKDD 2022) and KGTuner. This reduces computational cost by ~80% while maintaining parameter transferability.

## Step 1: Create Representative Subgraph

```bash
# Create 20% subgraph (170k from 850k nodes)
python create_subgraph.py
```

This creates:
- `experiments/data/subgraph.ndjson` - Subgraph in NDJSON format
- `experiments/data/subgraph.bin` - Binary format for fast loading
- `experiments/data/subgraph_metadata.json` - Sampling information

The subgraph is created using **multi-start random walks** from high-degree nodes to preserve:
- Degree distribution
- Clustering patterns
- Power law properties
- Edge weight distribution

## Step 2: Verify Subgraph Representativeness

```bash
# Calculate metrics for full graph (if not done)
python calculate_graph_metrics.py

# Calculate metrics for subgraph
python calculate_graph_metrics.py \
  --input experiments/data/subgraph.ndjson \
  --output-name subgraph_metrics

# Compare metrics
python compare_graph_metrics.py
```

The comparison shows:
- Degree distribution similarity
- Power law preservation
- Reciprocity maintenance
- Overall representativeness score

**Target**: <10% difference in key metrics (mean degree, Gini coefficient, reciprocity)

## Step 3: Run Experiments on Subgraph

### Phase 1: FastRP Parameter Optimization
Test dimensions (16, 64, 128, 256) × q values (2, 3, 4)

```bash
# Generate embeddings for all Phase 1 configs on SUBGRAPH
python generate_all_embeddings.py all --single-seed \
  --graph experiments/data/subgraph.ndjson

# Evaluate all embeddings
python evaluate_all_embeddings.py
```

### Phase 2: PCA Impact Test
Test best FastRP config with/without PCA preprocessing

```bash
# Create phase2_pca_test.json config
# Run with best FastRP parameters from Phase 1
python generate_all_embeddings.py all \
  --config-file phase2_pca_test.json \
  --graph experiments/data/subgraph.ndjson
```

### Phase 3: PaCMAP Tuning (if doing 2D)
Test n_neighbors (10, 15, 30) with best FastRP+PCA config

```bash
# Create phase3_pacmap_tuning.json config
python generate_all_embeddings.py all \
  --config-file phase3_pacmap_tuning.json \
  --graph experiments/data/subgraph.ndjson
```

## Step 4: Validate on Full Graph

```bash
# Run ONLY the best configuration on full graph with 5 seeds
python run_embedding.py \
  --config best_config \
  --seeds 25 42 123 456 789 \
  --graph ../data/graph.ndjson

# Evaluate with multiple seeds
python evaluate_all_embeddings.py --aggregate-seeds
```

## Computational Savings

**Traditional approach** (all on full graph):
- Phase 1: 11 configs × 5 seeds = 55 runs
- Phase 2: 2 configs × 5 seeds = 10 runs
- Phase 3: 3 configs × 5 seeds = 15 runs
- **Total: 80 full-graph runs**

**Our approach** (optimize on subgraph):
- Phase 1-3: 16 configs on 20% graph ≈ 3.2 full-graph equivalents
- Validation: 1 config × 5 seeds = 5 full-graph runs
- **Total: 8.2 full-graph equivalent** (~90% reduction!)

## For The Paper

### Methodology Section
> "We perform hyperparameter optimization on a representative 20% subgraph (170k nodes) constructed via multi-start random walks from high-degree nodes, following established practices [1,2]. The subgraph preserves key graph properties including degree distribution (mean difference: X%), power law characteristics (α difference: Y%), and reciprocity (difference: Z%). This approach reduces computational cost by 90% while maintaining parameter transferability, as validated on the full 850k-node graph."
